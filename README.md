## Notes for Grzegorz:

For the sake of transparency, I would like to declare the following, to ensure that I acted within the rules.

1. - In total, the exercise has taken just above 2 hours in total.
2. - I would still add restrictions for the 'show_more' & 'show_less' buttons, so that, user cannot press them, once 'currentView' within state is 0; Due to time, I have forgone this exercise.
3. - I used MDN for referencing of table element tags.
4. - I googled 'React Lifecycle methods' to remind myself to make the ajax call within the correct (recommended) lifecycle method;
5. - I copied the repo locally and worked on the project on local server as I found it challenging not having access to devtools & syntax highlighting within 'codesandbox'.
6. - I presume, this was not an exercise to display CSS skills, hence no CSS done.
7. - I used 'create-react-app' to quickly generate the dev environment. Please see this path if you would like to see the full code online on github.
github : https://github.com/Kay2dan/repo_list
8. - The codesandbox.io is not liking my import files & giving an error 'invariant'. I'll look into this.
9. - The github demo is fully functional including the bonus task required.
