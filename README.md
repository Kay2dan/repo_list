Notes for Grzegorz:

For the sake of transparency, I would like to declare the following, to ensure that I acted within the rules.

1 - In total, the exercise has taken just above 2 hours in total.
2 - I would still add restrictions for the 'show_more' & 'show_less' buttons, so that, user cannot press then once 'currentView' within state is 0; Due to time, I have forgone this exercise.
3 - I used MDN for referencing of table element tags.
4 - I googled 'React Lifecycle methods' to remind myself that I make the ajax call within the correct (recommended) lifecycle method;
5 - I copied the repo locally and worked on the project on local server as I found it challenging not having access to console.log within 'codesandbox'.
6 - I presume, this was not an exercise to display CSS skills.
6 - I used 'create-react-app' to quickly generate the dev environment. Please see this path if you would like to see the full code online.
